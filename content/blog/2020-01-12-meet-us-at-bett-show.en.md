Friends, I would like to invite you to the Bett Show, which takes place from 22nd to 25th January in London. If you do not know the event, it is Europe's largest exhibition about education at all levels. If you are going to the Bett Show, we will be happy to see you at our stand. You can still [register as visitor](https://www.bettshow.com/visiting-bett/bett-2020-visitor-registration) for free.


We will focus on our active STEM education - how to get started and how to use our industrial IoT Kits, for example in combination with Raspberry Pi or Micro: bit.

We will also introduce our **research-based pedagogical framework**, which we’ve created together with EdVisor Finland during our participation in the largest EdTech accelerator xEdu. We will present you a sample lesson that you can fully take and apply in your school or organization and a case study from [John Lyon School](https://www.johnlyon.org) in London.

## Competition

There will be a quiz contest throughout the Bett Show. The prize is a sample lesson (2x 45 minutes) worth € 490, which will take place at your school.
Let us know you'll stop!

Email me at [lukas.fabik@hardwario.com](mailto:lukas.fabik@hardwario.com) that you would like to meet us. I and my colleagues will look forward to you! Our stand No. NA51 can be found in the Learning Tech section, right by the main street.
