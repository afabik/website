  In 2016, we started our mission and brought our IoT kit into the world under the brand name BigClown. This name was a reference to the “qualities” of the company´s co-founders, namely Big Pavel (not just his height!) and Clown Alan (not always the case!). BigClown will now be known as HARDWARIO.

In 2016, we started our mission and brought our IoT kit into the world under the brand name BigClown. This name was a reference to the “qualities” of the company´s co-founders, namely Big Pavel (not just his height!) and Clown Alan (not always the case!).

The BigClown brand provoked mixed reactions among the world of budding inventors from the very start, gaining supporters as well as a few opponents :). Unfortunately, as our kit started to gain traction within the industrial and educational fields, it became evident that the BigClown brand was not being seen as a strength, rather a weakness. You can imagine what the management of CEZ might think when signing a contract with clowns :). With our growing focus on Industry 4.0 pilot projects, active STEM education, and our endeavours to make communication easier, we have decided to unite the products of our company under a new brand name. As a result, BigClown will now be known as HARDWARIO. It goes without saying that the clown will stay in our hearts, and will for some time still figure on some of our modules due to the stocks we have.

## HARDWARIO = Multifunctional industrial IoT kits
We now present HARDWARIO as multifunctional industrial IoT kits, which are used especially for Industry 4.0 pilot projects, home-based DIY automatization projects and active STEM education. The main advantages of our kits remain the same, namely their industrial quality, low-power design, easy assembly, high degree of integration and wide range of IoT connectivity. We also provide professional technical support and a three-year warranty on all our products.

## Let’s meet in person
We enjoy meeting people who are interested in hardware, IoT and STEM education. That is why we organise a wide range of webinars and seminars on a continuous basis. At this point in time, you can register for the [#Breakfast 4_0 event](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/breakfast-40-london-inspiration-from-the-world-of-internet-of-things-communications-technology-tickets-64531538569) which will take place on Wednesday, 11th February in London or for our online IoT webinar [Industry 4.0 pilot projects on the following day](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/iot-piloty-prumyslu-40-do-druheho-dne-prakticky-online-webinar-tickets-84150964801) (in Czech language). Soon we will announce dates of English versions. Beyond this, and not in the too distant future, you can also look forward to a new series of webinars on, among other things, active STEM education. In addition, we will show you what we learned during our successful participation in the Finnish accelerator XEdu. A short description of our approach to STEM education, including the pedagogical framework, is available to download from our website.

As a part of aforementioned changes, all the important content from the BigClown website has been transferred to www.hardwario.com. We have also launched a [new shop](https://shop.hardwario.com) under the same brand name. In the next few days, we will transfer the documentation and forums, and over time, the repositories on GitHub as well.

Stay with us and together we will inspire the inventors of tomorrow. 

Kind regards,

Alan
