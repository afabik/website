<p>By digitizing and implementing IoT technologies, smart organizations gain a competitive advantage by dramatically improving their efficiency, productivity, customer experience, and generating new revenue streams. In our popular webinars, together with our partners, we present successful IoT projects and openly describe used solutions and technologies. Webinar includes a discussion with developers, implementers and customers.</p>

<p><strong>In the new IoT webinar, we will show you how, together with Vodafone UK, we have handled the challenge of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of the United Kingdom and made it easier to collect data to research the impact of climate change on tree growth</strong>. We will talk about the implementation of NB-IoT technology, HARDWARIO CHESTER and EMS Dendrometer devices, REST API and Grafana application.</p>
