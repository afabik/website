### The topic
In the new IoT webinar, we will show you how, together with Vodafone UK, we have handled the challenge of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of the United Kingdom and made it easier to collect data to research the impact of climate change on tree growth. We will talk about the implementation of NB-IoT technology, HARDWARIO CHESTER and EMS Dendrometer devices, REST API and Grafana application.
