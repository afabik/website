**E.ON**, a German energy company, is one of the **leading suppliers of electricity and gas** in the Czech Republic and throughout Europe. They strive for reliability and a customer-friendly approach and **rank among the leaders in the field of innovation** in the Czech Republic. This is why we were pleased when E.ON asked us to help them with further innovations. In a single project, we had to consider two requirements: to create a battery-powered **temperature and humidity sensor for cable boxes** and, at the same time, **to test the new NB-IoT communication network**.

Cable boxes are prone to **high humidity and temperature**. Improper climatic conditions lead to corrosion, breakage of HRC fuses and, hence, a **significant increase in maintenance costs**.

Therefore, it is crucial for E.ON to select the supplier of cable boxes whose products are the most resistant to climate conditions. To compare individual suppliers, E.ON decided to **monitor humidity and temperature** in each cable box **online**. Therefore, E.ON needed a sensor that would provide them with temperature and humidity reports on
a daily basis for subsequent analysis.

At the same time, E.ON wished to try another innovation â€“ the NB-IoT narrow-band network newly offered by Vodafone. This is the only LTE- based data network with great coverage, even under the ground, specifically designed for smart devices.
