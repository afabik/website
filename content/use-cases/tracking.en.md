[CHESTER](/en/chester/) with integrated GNSS module (GPS, Galileo, GLONASS) is an ideal tool for asset tracking.

The solution is suitable for demanding outdoor projects thanks to its water/dust resistance and wide operating temperature range.

The low power consumption and LPWAN connectivity allow deployment in places not covered by the GSM signal or power grid.
