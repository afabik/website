[CHESTER](/en/chester/), thanks to its robustness, finds its place in more demanding indoor air quality monitoring projects, especially in agriculture and industrial spaces.

Through its integrated sensors, it measures temperature, relative air humidity, concentration of CO, CO2, LPG, or NH3 (ammonia).

The low power consumption and LPWAN connectivity allow deployment in places not covered by the GSM signal or power grid.
