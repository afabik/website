You can equip [CHESTER](/chester/) with one or more push buttons and monitor the press events online.

The solution is suitable for demanding outdoor projects thanks to its water/dust resistance and wide operating temperature range.

The low power consumption and LPWAN connectivity allow deployment in places not covered by the GSM signal or power grid.
