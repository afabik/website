[CHESTER](/chester/) can process data from a wide selection of environmental sensors, e.g. temperature, relative air humidity, NOx and SOx, soil moisture, and many more.

The solution is suitable for use in agriculture, forestry, water management, and industrial spaces, thanks to its water/dust resistance and wide operating temperature range.

The low power consumption and LPWAN connectivity allow deployment in places not covered by the GSM signal or power grid.
